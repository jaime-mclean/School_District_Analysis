# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

---
This analysis explores the standardized testing scores and passing percentages in math and reading and the overall test passing rates for 15 high schools in the district. Testing performance is examined by all students and performance for each grade level at all 15 schools. The district-wide testing is evaluated based on school spending per student, school size, and school type. Due to suspected academic dishonesty in the math and reading scores for 9th graders from Thomas High Schools, the analysis was repeated with the Thomas High ninth graders' scores omitted. The Thomas High School scores were recalculated with the freshman scores ommitted and the student counts re-calculated to include only the 10th through 12th grade student.

## Results

---
The removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders' scores had a small but measurable impact on the distric-wide metrics:
* Total Students: 
  *  did not change for the purpose of calculating school size and per capita spend. 
  *  The 461 9th graders were removed from the mean testing score calculations and the percentage passing scores.
*  Total Budget: No change
*  Average Math Score: dropped one tenth of a point, from 79.0 to 78.9
*  Average Reading score: stayed constant at 81.9
*  % Passing Math: dropped 2 tenths of 1% from 75.0% to 74.8%
*  % Passing Reading: dropped 1 tenth of 1% from 85.8% to 85.7%
*  % Overall Passing: dropped 3 tenths of 1% from 65.2% to 64.9%

## Summary

---
Although the changes in the overall district scores were very small, it is apparent that four of the five testing metrics were skewed by the Thomas High School 9th graders. This is not evidence of academic dishonesty, but this is the direction I would expect the scores to change if there was some dishonesty taking place. The 9th grade class at Thomas High School makes up slightly less than 1.2% of the total students, so changes to district-wide metrics would be expected to be small even if there was extreme academic dishonesty involved.
